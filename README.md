<h2>Design Patterns Overview</h2>

This repository provides a comprehensive guide to various design patterns in software development. Design patterns are proven solutions to recurring design problems, encapsulating best practices to improve code maintainability, scalability, and flexibility. This repo will focus on explaining important design patterns: Singleton, Strategy, Command, Adapter, Factory, Decorator, Abstract Factory, and Composite.

## Singleton Pattern

The Singleton pattern ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.

## Strategy Pattern

The Strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each algorithm, and makes them interchangeable. It allows the client to choose the appropriate algorithm at runtime.

## Command Pattern

The Command pattern encapsulates a request as an object, allowing for parameterization of clients with different requests, queuing of requests, and logging of the parameters.
 
## Adapter Pattern

The Adapter pattern allows incompatible interfaces to work together. It acts as a bridge, converting the interface of a class into another interface that a client expects.

## Factory Pattern

The Factory pattern defines an interface for creating an object but leaves the choice of its type to the subclasses, creating instances of classes without specifying their concrete classes.

## Decorator Pattern

The Decorator pattern attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. It provides a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

## Abstract Factory Pattern
The Abstract Factory pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

## Composite Pattern

The Composite pattern composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. It lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

</h2>Observer Pattern</h2>

The Observer pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, where changes in one object (the subject) are reflected automatically in dependent objects (observers). This pattern is commonly used to implement distributed event-handling systems.
